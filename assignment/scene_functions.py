DIGM 131 - Assignment 3: Function Library (scene_functions.py)
===============================================================

OBJECTIVE:
    Create a library of reusable functions that each generate a specific
    type of scene element. This module will be imported by main_scene.py.

REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Implement at least 5 reusable functions.
    2. Every function must have a complete docstring with Args and Returns.
    3. Every function must accept parameters for position and/or size so
       they can be reused at different locations and scales.
    4. Every function must return the name(s) of the Maya object(s) it creates.
    5. Follow PEP 8 naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables).

GRADING CRITERIA:
    - [30%] At least 5 functions, each creating a distinct scene element.
    - [25%] Functions accept parameters and use them (not hard-coded values).
    - [20%] Every function has a complete docstring (summary, Args, Returns).
    - [15%] Functions return the created object name(s).
    - [10%] Clean, readable code following PEP 8.
